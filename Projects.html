        <h3>Resturo-Comparison</h3>
        <p><strong>Short Description:</strong> A cross-platform solution integrating a website and mobile app to enhance user engagement with local restaurants through real-time, location-based services.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> React, React Native, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Google Maps API, Firebase Authentication, Stripe API.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> This project involves the development of a unified platform that connects users with nearby restaurants. It allows users to access live data about restaurant offers, compare dish prices, read and post reviews, and explore event listings. The system also enables direct food ordering, table reservations, and participation in restaurant-hosted events. A unique feature is its investment module, empowering restaurant owners to publish partnership opportunities for potential investors to explore.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Many users struggle to find nearby restaurants offering the best prices, quality, and promotions in one place. Restaurant owners also lack a centralized digital platform to advertise offers, manage events, and attract investors. This project aims to bridge that gap through a unified, interactive digital ecosystem.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Primary Audience:</strong> Everyday consumers looking for nearby restaurants, deals, and events based on their location.</li>
          <li><strong>Secondary Audience:</strong> Restaurant owners seeking to promote their services, manage bookings, and attract investment opportunities, as well as potential investors interested in collaborating with local food businesses.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Unique Proposition:</strong> Combines restaurant discovery, ordering, event booking, and investment opportunities within a single, user-friendly interface supported by secure transactions and real-time updates.</p>
